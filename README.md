### 🏝️ **[2024.05.18]** BSides Puerto Rico - *Shift Down: Foundational Security with Internal Developer Platforms*

```diff
+ PROTOCOL: Talk | FORMAT: Solo Presentation
+ TOPIC: Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)
+ CONCEPT: "Shift Down" Security Architecture  
+ PLATFORMS: Cortex + Backstage Demonstrations
```

Talk presented by myself at BSides PR.

When we use the term platform we can use it in many contexts, here we explore two. First, platform meaning the hosting layer and environment that applications are deployed upon. The second, the self-service interface, tools and mechanisms by which individuals can build and expand upon that underlying hosting layer. Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) sit within this second context, but leverage the first. An IDP enables platform teams to produce a catalog of reusable infrastructure templates and patterns. Supported by portal interfaces product engineers can leverage these reusable components to deploy supporting services themselves. IDP products such as Cortex and Backstage provide the opportunity for security and governance to be baked into these templating processes, ensuring secure-by-design infrastructure. Not only do we have self-service infrastructure, but self-service security. Here engineers can implement pre-canned secure components and shift security downwards. Complementing the move to “shift-left”, “shifting down” lets engineering teams take advantage of the pre-defined “security as code” available at the platform level. This allows teams to focus on the things that count, such as delivering new products, and not worrying about securely deploying infrastructure. In turn it also aids in reducing the burden placed on Infrastructure and DevOps teams. In this talk I will demonstrate how we can reduce the cognitive load on engineering teams to “learn all the security things” by using a “shift down” approach to secure platform development and the roll out of Internal Developer Platforms.

## DEFCON Recon Village 2023: The Perils of Generative AI: Implications for Open Source Intelligence Research
Presented by myself

The rapid advancement and proliferation of Generative AI in social media and other digital platforms have sparked significant discussion about their potential impact on various sectors, including Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) research. OSINT, a critical resource in security, intelligence, and research fields, heavily relies on social media and other platforms to gather and analyze publicly available data. With the recent proliferation of  Large Language Models (LLMs) and their interaction with these platforms, concerns have emerged about their potential to hinder the efficacy and integrity of OSINT.


This talk will first provide a background on Generative AI and OSINT, explaining the capabilities of LLMs and the importance of OSINT in various fields. It will then delve into how LLMs are/can be used with social media and other platforms, and their potential influence on OSINT research.


We will discuss several challenges posed by LLMs to OSINT. These include issues of data validity and reliability, as the difficulty in distinguishing between human generated and Generative AI generated content can lead to skewed or false data. The potential for information pollution and spread of misinformation is another significant concern, especially given the capacity of LLMs to generate large volumes of persuasive and contextually relevant content. Moreover, problems related to source attribution and provenance may arise, adding a layer of complexity to the analysis of open source data. Lastly, the potential of Generative AI for AI driven influence operations could distort the information landscape, posing further challenges to OSINT.


Possible solutions and mitigation strategies will be proposed, which include enhancing data validation and verification techniques, improving AI literacy among OSINT researchers, advocating for more transparency around Generative AI usage in social media, and employing AI tools to detect and flag AI generated content.


The future of LLMs and other forms of Generative AI and their potential impact on OSINT will be discussed, with a focus on emerging trends and technologies. Suggestions for further research and study on this issue will be provided, highlighting the urgent need for continued vigilance and proactive measures in the face of rapidly evolving LLM capabilities.


In conclusion, the talk will underscore the importance of this issue for the OSINT community, emphasizing the need for ongoing research and adaptive strategies to navigate the challenges posed by the increasing use of Generative AI in social media and other platforms. The session will close with Q&A, offering an opportunity for further discussion by the Recon village audience.

## BSides CT 2020: A basic guide to COBOL Security
Presented by myself

COBOL has come back onto the radar of many of us in the tech industry during 2020 due to the large number of legacy systems struggling to cope with increased traffic. We all heard about unemployment systems in New Jersey lacking the skilled engineers required to help improve COBOL based systems. But did you know, COBOL is still widely used in the banking sector and elsewhere? In this talk we will look at some of the security steps you can take to improve a COBOL systems security posture. Whether maintaining COBOL systems as an engineer, or performing threat modeling on then, this is the talk for you!

## BSides CT 2019: Election hacking defined and how to fight back
Presented by myself

Content was dervived from my Masters thesis.

What does election hacking mean?

Coming up with a definition is fraught with difficulties. Where are the boundaries where an incident is no longer considered hacking, but some other crime? The term is often thrown around in the media but can be ill-defined & nebulous.

Each jurisdiction implements different rules for whom can donate and participate in elections. Is illegal funding an election campaign hacking, or electoral fraud? Do these types of actions which predate the Internet, & computing, in general, constitute hacking?

Typical ways of throwing elections from fraudulent ballots to ballot stuffing have been observed in multiple countries. Should these be considered hacking too?

In this presentation drawing upon research conducted from 2017 through 2019, we will seek to narrow the term down into something more concrete. With this goal in mind, we will then look at six proposed attack vectors (called the hexad) that comprise the attack surface elections & referendum can face from hackers.

Following this, we will walk through some real-world examples of actions that meet this criterion, and how some campaigns have successfully fought back. The talk will wrap up with some thoughts on how future electoral campaigns can defend against nefarious actors.
