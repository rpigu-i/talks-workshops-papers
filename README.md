### 🏝️ **[2024.05.18]** BSides Puerto Rico - *Shift Down: Foundational Security with Internal Developer Platforms*

```diff
+ PROTOCOL: Talk | FORMAT: Solo Presentation
+ TOPIC: Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)
+ CONCEPT: "Shift Down" Security Architecture  
+ PLATFORMS: Cortex + Backstage Demonstrations
```

Talk presented by myself at BSides PR.

When we use the term platform we can use it in many contexts, here we explore two. First, platform meaning the hosting layer and environment that applications are deployed upon. The second, the self-service interface, tools and mechanisms by which individuals can build and expand upon that underlying hosting layer. Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) sit within this second context, but leverage the first. An IDP enables platform teams to produce a catalog of reusable infrastructure templates and patterns. Supported by portal interfaces product engineers can leverage these reusable components to deploy supporting services themselves. IDP products such as Cortex and Backstage provide the opportunity for security and governance to be baked into these templating processes, ensuring secure-by-design infrastructure. Not only do we have self-service infrastructure, but self-service security. Here engineers can implement pre-canned secure components and shift security downwards. Complementing the move to “shift-left”, “shifting down” lets engineering teams take advantage of the pre-defined “security as code” available at the platform level. This allows teams to focus on the things that count, such as delivering new products, and not worrying about securely deploying infrastructure. In turn it also aids in reducing the burden placed on Infrastructure and DevOps teams. In this talk I will demonstrate how we can reduce the cognitive load on engineering teams to “learn all the security things” by using a “shift down” approach to secure platform development and the roll out of Internal Developer Platforms.

### 🤖 **[2023.08.11]** DEFCON Recon Village - *The Perils of Generative AI: Implications for Open Source Intelligence Research*

```diff
+ PROTOCOL: Research Presentation | FORMAT: Solo Talk
+ DOMAIN: OSINT + AI Security Research
+ VENUE: Recon Village | DEFCON 31
+ THREAT_VECTOR: Generative AI Impact on Intelligence Gathering
```

**ABSTRACT:**  
The rapid advancement and proliferation of Generative AI in social media and other digital platforms have sparked significant discussion about their potential impact on various sectors, including Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) research. OSINT, a critical resource in security, intelligence, and research fields, heavily relies on social media and other platforms to gather and analyze publicly available data. With the recent proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their interaction with these platforms, concerns have emerged about their potential to hinder the efficacy and integrity of OSINT.

**CORE TOPICS:**
- Background on Generative AI and OSINT capabilities  
- LLM integration with social media platforms
- Data validity and reliability challenges
- Information pollution and misinformation vectors
- Source attribution and provenance complexity
- AI-driven influence operations detection
- Mitigation strategies and validation techniques

Security tooling can be expensive, very expensive. Never fear though, there are a multitude of cheap and open source options out there. You too can build a robust DevSecOps pipeline on a dollar store budget.

Covering everything from open source SAST tools to free secret scanning and Infrastructure-as-Code audits, this talk walks you through options to build out CI/CD pipelines that help to secure your code base without taking out a second mortgage.

Some basic knowledge of DevOps and CI/CD would be useful but is not mandatory.

COBOL has come back onto the radar of many of us in the tech industry during 2020 due to the large number of legacy systems struggling to cope with increased traffic. We all heard about unemployment systems in New Jersey lacking the skilled engineers required to help improve COBOL based systems. But did you know, COBOL is still widely used in the banking sector and elsewhere? In this talk we will look at some of the security steps you can take to improve a COBOL systems security posture. Whether maintaining COBOL systems as an engineer, or performing threat modeling on then, this is the talk for you!

### 🗳️ **[2019.11.16]** BSides Connecticut - *Election hacking defined and how to fight back*

```diff
+ PROTOCOL: Research Presentation | SOURCE: Masters Thesis
+ DOMAIN: Electoral Security + Attack Vector Analysis
+ METHODOLOGY: Hexad Attack Surface Model
+ TIMELINE: Research Period 2017-2019
```

**RESEARCH ABSTRACT:**
Content was derived from my Masters thesis.

What does election hacking mean? Coming up with a definition is fraught with difficulties. Where are the boundaries where an incident is no longer considered hacking, but some other crime? The term is often thrown around in the media but can be ill-defined & nebulous.

**KEY RESEARCH QUESTIONS:**
- Is illegal funding an election campaign hacking, or electoral fraud?
- Do these types of actions which predate the Internet, & computing, in general, constitute hacking?
- Should traditional ballot stuffing be considered hacking too?

**METHODOLOGY:**
In this presentation drawing upon research conducted from 2017 through 2019, we will seek to narrow the term down into something more concrete. With this goal in mind, we will then look at six proposed attack vectors (called the hexad) that comprise the attack surface elections & referendum can face from hackers.

Following this, we will walk through some real-world examples of actions that meet this criterion, and how some campaigns have successfully fought back. The talk will wrap up with some thoughts on how future electoral campaigns can defend against nefarious actors.
